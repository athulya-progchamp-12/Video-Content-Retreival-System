# InVideoSearch

**Video Content Retrieval System**

This repository contains the project files for a Video Content Retrieval System developed as a final-year project. The system extracts keyframes from video, generates captions, and performs semantic search to retrieve relevant video segments based on textual queries.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or unzip the package.
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the notebook Final File.ipynb with Jupyter/Colab.

## Notes
- Large videos are not included. Add videos to `data/` or update `.gitignore` to exclude outputs when pushing to GitHub.
